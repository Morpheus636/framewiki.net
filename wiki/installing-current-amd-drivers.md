The AMD drivers included with Framework's driver bundles are generally updated only when a new BIOS version is released, meaning they can be out of date. It may be useful to update the graphics driver for the latest game compatibility or driver features. However, Framework's official recommendation is that users run the drivers included in the driver bundle for their device.[^2]

Community members have found AMD driver version 24.7.1 to be stable.[^1] Version 24.8.1 is also generally stable but includes a bug where the Radeon control panel will launch randomly when the computer resumes from sleep.

There have been mixed reports of version 24.12.1 working on the latest BIOS version. Users in the Framework Discord server have reported success installing 24.12.1 after updating the BIOS of their Framework Laptop 16. But, others have reported that 24.12.1 is still failing to install. So, if you would like a stable install please use 24.7.1 or 24.8.1. [[citation-needed]](/framewiki:citation-needed)
