# Framework Laptop 16
{% include sidecar.html %}
**Framework Laptop 16** is [Framework](/framework-computer-inc)'s second product, announced March 23, 2023 at the Next Level event. [^1] Pre-orders opened July 18 of the same year. [^2] The first laptops shipped in February, 2024. [^7] 

Framework Laptop 16 is available with AMD Ryzen 7 7840HS and Ryzen 9 7940HS CPUs. Customers can optionally add an [AMD Radeon RX7700S GPU](/expansion-bay/radeon-rx-7700s), which connects via the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay).

## Customization
Framework Laptop 16's flagship features are the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay) and [input module](/input-modules) systems. Input modules allow users to rearrange the laptop's input deck, allowing them to add a combination of a keyboard, trackpad, number pads, macro pads, and decorative covers in various positions on the laptop's C Cover. The Expansion bay allows users to install functional modules, such as a graphics card or additional M.2 slots, using a custom slot at the back of the laptop.

Framework Laptop 16 also has six [expansion card](/expansion-cards) slots. Like [Framework Laptop 13](/framework-laptop-13), Framework offers multiple bezel color options for visual customization.

### GPU
An AMD Radeon RX 7700S, featuring 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 100W TGP, and 2 Cooler Master fans, can be installed via the [expansion bay](/expansion-bay).

### Connectivity
#### Expansion Cards
Framework Laptop 16 supports USB 4 on ports 1 and 4, and USB 3.2 on all other ports. Ports 1, 2, 4 and 5 support 240W charging. Ports 1,2 and 4 support DisplayPort Alt Mode Plugging a USB-A expansion card into ports 1 and 4 may result in higher power consumption. [^8]

Framework Laptop 16 is not Thunderbolt certified, though many Thunderbolt devices and docks function when connected to a USB-4-compatible port.

#### Expansion Bay
The [expansion bay](/expansion-bay) connector includes power, DisplayPort and PCIe signaling.

#### Wireless
Framework Laptop 16 comes with the AMD RZ616 Wi-Fi Card, which supports WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. [^5][^6]

## Hardware Compatibility
### RAM
Framework Laptop 16 features two DDR5 SO-DIMM sockets. Framework offers their own [Framework-branded DDR5-5600](https://frame.work/marketplace/memory-storage?search=DDR5) modules in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB variants. [^3]

Standard DDR5 JEDEC (non-XMP) timings are supported. ECC is not supported. [^4]

### SSD
Framework Laptop 16 supports up to two NVMe SSDs -- one full-size M.2 2280, and another mini M.2 2230-sized drive stacked below the other. [^3] Framework Laptop 16 is the first Framework product to support more than one internal SSD.
## Known Issues
### Liquid Metal Pump Out
On Framework Laptop 16 devices with liquid metal thermal interface material, performance may degrade over time due to the liquid metal pumping out of the CPU.[^11] To address the issue, Framework switched new production laptops to use Honeywell PTM7958 phase-change thermal interface paste. Owners of laptops with liquid metal can request a Honeywell PTM7950 thermal pad from Framework.[^12] Framework says the PTM7958 has "equivalently strong" performance to the original liquid metal.
