# Expansion Bay

The **Expansion Bay** is a custom slot on the back of [Framework Laptop 16](/framework-laptop-16).

## Cooling
The expansion bay contains the cooling fans for Framework laptop 16. For this reason, an expansion bay module must be installed whenever the laptop is in use. 

## First-Party Modules
By default, Framework Laptop 16 comes with the [Expansion Bay Shell](/expansion-bay/shell). The shell's included fan controller board can be replaced with the [Dual M.2 Adapter](/expansion-bay/dual-m2) to add support for up to two M.2 SSDs.

Users can replace the default Expansion Bay Shell with a dedicated GPU for more graphics-heavy workloads. Currently, the only option is an AMD [Radeon RX 7700S](/expansion-bay/radeon-rx-7700s). The AMD Radeon RX 7700S module includes 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a 100W TGP, and 2 Cooler Master fans --- the same as the ones included in the Expansion Bay Shell [^4]. The module increases the length of the laptop to 290.2mm and increases the thickness to 20.95mm/ [^2]

## Technical Details
{% include wip.html %}
The Expansion Bay interface uses a custom connector that includes power and signaling for 8-lane PCIe, DisplayPort input and control for the internal display. [^3]
